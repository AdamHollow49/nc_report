# nc_report
NC reporting tool

This script will convert your factory non-conformance information into a chart showing pending and overdue non-conformances awaiting corrective action. This script will also provide a doughnut chart showing these numbers and a separate chart containing a breakdown of non-conformances raised vs day of the week, allowing for analysis.


You must replace 'L140 NC SPREADSHEET.xlsx' with the relevant spreadsheet inside reportNC.py
Your spreadsheet must contain "DUE DATE", "NCGR. NO", "DATE COMPLETED" and "DATE RAISED" columns.
